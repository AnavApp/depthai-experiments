## Gen2 Blur Faces in Real Time

This example shows how to blur detected faces in real-time. Face blurring happens on the host, with the help of OpenCV. You could also create
a custom CV model ([tutorial](https://docs.luxonis.com/en/latest/pages/tutorials/creating-custom-nn-models/)) that would blur the frame based on the bounding boxes.

## Demo
